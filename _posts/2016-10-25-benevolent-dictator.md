In Praqma, we believe in the power of open source to change the world.  Throughout our history we have been contributing to open source projects as well as creating our own, in collaboration with our clients.
{: .kicker}

We have a busy team of _CoDe miners_ digging out code nuggets to support both our consultants in the field and our countless Open Source projects in "The CoDe Alliance".  As our company has grown, so has the ambitions of our projects. Now we need a benevolent dictator to take the helm!

<!--break-->

Praqma has always been about delivering software _the way it should be done_; continuously, in drops, nicely wrapped up - together with delivery pipelines attached and useful documentation.

The software we produce is mostly Open Source. A lot of it is created in the context of our _"CoDe Alliance"_. It's an alliance that includes many of our  customers, where we engage in each others continuous delivery challenges and build useful stuff together, sharing the cost and releasing as Open Source to the community.

The CoDe Alliance is run by Praqma and we meet regularly to maintain an ambitious roadmap for all the development tools, utilities and extensions that we create in the alliance.

As our consultants in the field work with our clients they often spot and identify the need for new software ranging from small scripts to full fledged Open Source frameworks and tools.

This model is proving it's worth more and more every single day and we're getting really busy in the code mines.

## What's the job?

We're using the term _"Benevolent Dictator"_, and we expect that you're already sufficiently engaged in open Source terminology that you know what is meant by that.

You will work closely together with both the CoDe miners in the team, and our wolves and praqtitioners in the field. You will also be involved with the customers in the CoDe Alliance and you'll work together with our communications team to develop technical blogs and videos.

You will work with our event team to organize meetups and hackathons in all Scandinavian countries and you will probably do quite a bit of the presentations yourself - or support and encourage the CoDe miners to do it.

Our business is based on a moving target of the latest technologies and approaches. In Praqma, it is everyone's job to undertake research. But quite a lot of it is done in the CoDe mines, conducting this research and turning outcome into useful deliveries internally and to our clients is important.

## Are you it?

__We're on the lookout for a lead developer - maybe someone like you!__

Someone who can inspire the team, who keep a high standard on deliveries, who can run a tight ship, who can possess the  architectural overview and who is ambitious and constantly thinking in terms of generic configurable solutions - suitable for Open Source.

If you are this benevolent dictator then you _could_ probably write all the code yourself - if only there was enough time in the world - but since there isn't you have developed a skill for delegation and mentoring. People take pleasure in watching you work.

You have been doing software for quite a while now, maybe you're a senior developer who thinks along the lines _"how can I stay technical, and continue to develop code - and at the same time be an inspiration and a leader for others?"_.

If you have any questions before you do that, please call Lars on +45 20 87 25 30 or mail him on [lak@praqma.com](mailto:lak@praqma.com).
