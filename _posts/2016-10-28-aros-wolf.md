## We're hiring in Aarhus - Do you want to change the world?

In Praqma we do Continuous Delivery - that is we help our customers be better at delivering valuable software to their customers.
We don't build our customers software, we provide them with the expertise, know-how and training that enables them to efficiently and reliably release their code.

Right now we're experiencing massive growth, and we are looking for more Wolves in Aarhus.

From the Aarhus office we're primarily helping the manufacturing industry excel in their software process. We're helping companies like Grundfos, Siemens and BankData.

We have exciting new projects waiting for someone like you!
You will be engaged in implementing full-fledged continuous delivery pipelines and automated quality assurance eco-systems at our clients.
You will be the one that keeps the client vision and strategy fresh, and ensures that the client is moving in the right direction!
You will be surrounded by colleagues who have the same burning passion for this domain as yourself.
Joining us will feel like coming home.


In the near future we will even be establishing an office in GÃ¶teborg, so at this point we'er _especially_ interested to hear from you if you're located in this area.

 * You know the agile software development principles by heart.
 * You are familiar with open source, maybe you are already contributing to a community.
 * You are proud. You are good at what you do and you know your stuff - and still, you are improving.

Technologies (some, but not necessarily all of):

 * Build technologies, like Gradle, Maven, make,...
 * Jenkins CI, Git, GitHub/GitLab, Mercurial or other relevant open source technologies.
 * At least one, but preferably multiple scripting languages (Python, Groovy, Ruby, JavaScript,...)
 * Infrastructure technologies such as Vagrant, Docker, Chef, Puppet etc.
 * Cloud technologies such as AWS, Azure, Google Compute Engine
 * Atlassian's tool suite
 * IBM Rational's product suite
