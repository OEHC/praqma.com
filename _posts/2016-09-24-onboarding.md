**So, you're considering joining the Praqma tribe? Cool, We're looking forward to hear from you! Here's a short description on how we usually run our interview and onboarding process. Wether you're applying for an open job position, applying for an internship or approaching us unsolicited - it makes sense to read this post to the end**

<!--break-->

All our [open positions](../../about/jobs/) are listed here on our website. If you want to apply for an internship, you probably want to read about our approach to [Praqticums](../praqticum/) if you think that you have something to offer, and wanna be orange like the rest of us, but you can't see, that we have posted a vacant position that matches, then feel free to challenge us; send us an unsolicited application. We value initiative.

### We establish contact and mutual interest in each other

This is typically where you contact us, well sometimes it's the other way around. It's not really important. What is important is that we're a good fit for each other. We're proud of the culture and values we have in Praqma, but it's not like there exist a certain _Praqma culture_ that you're supposed to morph your self into. The culture is made of the people we are, and if you join our tribe, you will become part of the culture - not adapt to it, but influence it - with you!

Obviously we're interested in your skills, experiences and interests, but we're also interested in seeing, if you're interested in us. If there is a match.

When you apply for a job or an internship, we expect two things (both in `.pdf` format) from you:

* A CV
* A motivational letter

The CV is obvious, you all get that part. But not seldom, we see that it's the only thing we get - We don't hire no one on their CV alone.

You need to also send us a motivational letter; A letter where you put yourself in the context of Praqma, and explain to us, why this job has your name written all over it. Show us _who_ you are - not just _what_ you are.

We will read you motivational letter _before_ your CV - so be motivated!

### No due dates - we will hire you when we've found you

Please note, that our job openings most often don't have a due date; We will hire you when we've found you! We have had open positions, where we hired the first applicant the day after the job was listed, and we have had job openings that's been online for years; Not because we can't find anyone, but because we need more people that fits the bill.

Currently we're hiring at the speed of 1.5 new colleague per month. So don't sit on it - send your application _today_!

If we're good for each other we will take next step.

### We meet for an interview

When you meet us, we will go into depth with what Praqma is, how we work, and we will discuss how you like that way of working and together we will explore if there is that match between us. We might talk concrete upcoming assignments, but we will definitely tell you war stories from some of our existing clients. It's not that we will try to scare you off, but then again, if anything we say scares you, then it's good to get it out in the open: _Fail early_ is an important doctrine within CoDe.

Towards the end of such an interview we also touch on the topic: _Salary expectation_, so please give that a thought as well.

If, after such an interviews - actually sometimes several interviews - we still want to continue with each other, we might give you some homework.

### Homework.

First of all, you could score by watching - or recap - the movie "Pulp Fiction". We use a handful of the characters in the chapter of the movie called "The Bonnie Situation" to explain our business and how we approach consultancy. During our interview we might explain _Mr. Wolf_, _Jules_, _Vincent_, _Bonnie_, _Jimmi_ and _Marcellus Wallace_.

We might also give you a handful of small assignments. You _could_ see this as a test, but really we see it more as demonstration of your _personal techniques and approaches to assignments_ of that kind. The assignments will be relevant to the job you are applying for. But at the end of the day, we would pay more attention to the approach you used to solve the assignment, than the actual outcome. The solution of all the assignments we give you, could span as much as an estimated full day of work.

We hope you'll be up for it.

### Plan the onboarding

Our business is run as a fully self-sustained business, no heavy investors, we're not sitting on a pile of money. Most of our revenue is invested back into the company, the past two years we've grown more than 100% per year. What that means is that we might sometimes see, that we have found the absolute right candidate for Praqma, but we currently don't have the capacity to put them on the payroll, since we would also have to put them on the bench.

Occasionally we ask people to sit tight in their current jobs (we call them _sleepers_) and wait for us to call upon them. Sometimes if we're talking Praqma _prospects_; people we need to mold or train a little bit in our knowledge domain, we would often taken them in immediately and have them working internally in our _CoDe mines_ or Open Source projects, to learn how to talk the talk and walk the walk.

## Salary and pay raises

Many people change job, simply to get a pay raise.

We don't believe you should join Praqma to get a better salary. We also believe that, if we shall give anyone a pay raise, it's because they earned it - with us. When you start with Praqma, we will typically be prepared to match the salary you had in you previous job. But if you come from a really boring job, we also sometimes see, that you are compensated for boredom - with a high salary.

But Praqma is not boring - and it has actually happened a few times, that people will have to settle back to the salary level for an _exciting_ job, and then work their way up from there, while with us.

We strive to support, that whatever career path you see for yourself, we want you to enable you to thread that path inside Praqma. Every employee will meet with management in a personal evaluation at least once every year. The expectation is that - like Praqma in general - you too will grow, while in Praqma. Your responsibilities will expand and when you grow you become more valuable too - you will typically get an annual pay raise while you're with us.
